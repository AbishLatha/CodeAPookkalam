# Code A Pookkalam

CodeAPookkalam is a Python project that creates a floral design (Pookkalam, in Malayalam language) using turtle graphics. The theme of the design is "SELF CARE" (precursor to HEALTHCARE, according to me) and it incorporates a heart symbol to represent self-love and care.

## Theme
The theme of the design is "selfcare," which is an important aspect of maintaining mental and physical health. 
The heart symbol is a universal symbol of love and care. In this design, the heart symbol represents self-love and care. It is a reminder that taking care of oneself is just as important as taking care of others.

## How to Run the Code
To run the CodeAPookkalam project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:
1. Download the CodeAPookkalam.py file from the project repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the CodeAPookkalam.py file is located.
3. Type python CodeAPookkalam.py and press Enter to run the program.
4. The program will generate a floral design based on the "selfcare" theme using turtle graphics.
